    "Description": "By combining a Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) and a Forward fully connected Neural Network (FNN) with an integrated gradients explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, the authors developed MolGrad and tested it on a number of ADME predictive tasks. MolGrad incorporates explainable features to facilitate interpretation of the predictions.\u00a0 This model has been trained using a ChEMBL dataset of CYP450 3A4 inhibitors (0) and non-inhibitors (1).",
